# cdramirezh-first-pkg

This package is the result of taking the Platzi's course on NPM.
The version 1.0.0 picks random funny messages from an array of funny messages. Which is exactly the same as the example in the course.
In the future I hope to personalize this packet and change its functionality.

## Install

```npm
npm install -g cdramirezh-first-pkg
